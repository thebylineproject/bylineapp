                                parties who are not signatories to these Terms), the Service, Okayplayer’s advertising or any related transaction (a “Claim”) shall be resolved exclusively and finally by binding arbitration administered by the American
                                Arbitration Association, in accordance with the Consumer Arbitration rules then in effect, or any other established alternative dispute resolution provider mutually agreed upon by you and Okayplayer. The Federal Arbitration
                                Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this section. The arbitration will be limited solely to the dispute between you and Okayplayer. Neither you nor Okayplayer shall be entitled to join or consolidate Claims
                                by or against other users or arbitrate any Claim as a representative or class action or in a private Attorney General capacity. The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to arbitrability
                                and/or enforceability of this arbitration provision, including any unconscionability challenge or any other challenge that the arbitration provision or the Agreement is void, voidable, or otherwise invalid. The arbitrator
                                will be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity. Any award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on you and Okayplayer and may be entered as a judgment in any court of
                                competent jurisdiction. You and Okayplayer shall pay your and its own costs and attorneys' fees. However, if you or Okayplayer prevails on a statutory Claim that affords the prevailing party attorneys' fees, or if there
                                is a written agreement providing for fees, the arbitrator may award reasonable fees to the prevailing party, under the standards for fee shifting provided by law. Arbitration shall take place in New York County, New York.</p>
