                                <li>(ii) We use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements on our behalf. These companies may use a cookie or an action tag to tailor the advertisements you see on this website and other sites, to track your

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>8. Data Retention and Account Termination</h4>
                    <p>You can close your account <a href="#">here</a> by following the appropriate links on our Service, or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:thebylineproject@gmail.com">thebylineproject@gmail.com.</a> Once your account is closed, no further data will
                        be collected, but we may retain information about you for the purposes authorized under this Privacy Policy, unless prohibited by law. Please note that we may automatically collect information about you through cookies, pixels
                        or the other tracking technologies described in this Privacy Policy if you revisit the Service after you have closed your account. To prevent this, you will need to adjust your browser settings before revisiting the Service.</p>
                    <p>You can update or correct personal information (e.g., your email address) by accessing your account. You can also access, rectify, or delete your information by reaching out to us at <a href="mailto:thebylineproject@gmail.com">thebylineproject@gmail.com</a>                        with your first name, last name, and the respective email addresses you would like for us to delete.</p>
                    <p>Please note that we have the right to reject deletion requests that are unduly burdensome or repetitive or that cannot be honored in light of legal obligations or ongoing disputes, or where retention is necessary to enforce our agreements
                        or protect our or another party’s rights, property, safety, or security. For example, we may retain information to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service or to comply with legal obligations.
                        Unless there is a specific legal requirement for us to keep the information, we plan to retain it for no longer than is necessary to fulfill a legitimate business need. Please also note that even after you have deleted your account,
                        other content associated with your use of the Service may still be accessible and viewable in accordance with applicable law and our Terms of Use.</p>
                    <h4>9. Children</h4>
                    <p>The Service is not directed to children under 16, and if we become aware that a child under 16 has provided us with personal data without parental consent, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the applicable account.</p>
                    <h4>10. Security</h4>
                    <p>We use commercially reasonable efforts to follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the internet
                        or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect information about you, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. </p>
                    <h4>11. EEA Users</h4>
                    <p>We endeavor to be fully compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). We may act, depending on the circumstances, as either or both a Controller and a Processor of personal data (as these terms are defined in the
                        GDPR). We act as the Controller of information that we automatically collect when you use the Service. We act as the Processor of user-generated content and information provided to us by third parties or other websites. EEA users
                        have the right to request access to personal data, as well as to seek to update, delete or correct their personal data.</p>
                    <h4>12. Your California Privacy Rights</h4>
                    <p>We recognize the need to provide further privacy protections with respect to personal data we may collect from California residents. California Civil Code Section § 1798.83 permits California residents that are users of our Service
                        to request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Data to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:thebylineproject@gmail.com">thebylineproject@gmail.com.</a></p>
                    <h4>13. Modifications to this Privacy Policy</h4>
                    <p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. You can see when it was last updated by looking at the effective date at the bottom of this page. If we make any significant changes we'll post them prominently on our website and notify
                        you by other means as required by law. Your continued use of the website after a revision to the Privacy Policy indicates your acceptance and agreement to the current Privacy Policy. We recommend that you periodically review the
                        Privacy Policy to make sure you understand and are up-to-date on how we're keeping your information safe.</p>
                    <h4>14. Contact Information</h4>
                    <p>If you have any further questions regarding our privacy practices or information about you, please feel free to contact us by email at <a href="mailto:thebylineproject@gmail.com">thebylineproject@gmail.com.</a></p>
